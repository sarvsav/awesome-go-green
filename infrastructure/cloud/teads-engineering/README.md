## About

Curious about the power consumption and carbon footprint of an EC2 instance? As part of the first Measure challenge, get an estimation below. This initiative is still a work in progress, data is provided as-is for open contribution purposes and without warranty.

## How to use?

Go to website: [Carbon footprint estimator for AWS instances](https://engineering.teads.com/sustainability/carbon-footprint-estimator-for-aws-instances/#calculator)

Fill the required values, and click on calculate. Below is an example,

The Teads Unofficial plugin can also be integrated with Impact Framework, and can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-unofficial-plugins).

On how to use impact framework teads aws plugin, refer this [Guide](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-unofficial-plugins/blob/main/src/lib/teads-aws/README.md).

Example manifest looks like this:

```yaml
