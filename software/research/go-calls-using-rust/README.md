# Go call using rust

## Where we spend energy?

We waste a lot of energy because we don't understand what it means to enter and exit scopes. Whenever you exit a function scope you move to another frame (calling a func) this includes methods, etc. Afterwards, you can find your memory footprint invoking the GC for the global count (300ms) etc.

## Where to use go, rust, c and other?

Go is more like a cloud networking language.
Languages close to hardware: Rust, C, C++, Zig, etc.,
then using things like wasm to make UIs more efficient.

## An article about using go with rust

Article by metal bear on attaching an assembly trampoline to translate Go calls into Rust calls.

- Go can handle concurrency
- all CPU intensive tasks could be handled by Rust before they are loaded onto the GC
- then Go handles all IO intensive tasks using Go routines.

Implementing package like this will help developers seamlessly pass through any green initiatives.
