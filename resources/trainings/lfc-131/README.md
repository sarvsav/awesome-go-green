# Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131) üìÑ

Learn the basic concepts a software practitioner needs to know to build, maintain and run greener applications

## How to register

You can register from The Linux Foundation using this [Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131)

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand and learn green principles.
- Understand and use our shared language and standardized terms.
- Apply green software principles to the design and development of your software applications

## Course content

1. Introduction - This chapter introduces some key concepts and also explains what
green software is and how to be a green software practitioner
2. Carbon Efficiency - This chapter explains the first principle of green software:
carbon efficiency, emitting the least amount of carbon possible per unit of work
3. Energy Efficiency - This chapter explains the second principle of green software:
energy efficiency, using the least amount of energy possible
4. Carbon Awareness -This chapter explains the third principle of green software:
carbon awareness, doing more when the electricity is cleaner and less when the
electricity is dirtier
5. Hardware Efficiency -This chapter explains the fourth principle of green software:
carbon awareness, using the least amount of embodied carbon possible
6. Measurements - This chapter explains the importance of measurement ‚Äì what you
can't measure, you can't improve
7. Climate Commitments -This chapter will help you understand the exact
mechanism of carbon reduction

## SCI Equation

```txt
SCI = (E *I) + M) per R
```

E = Energy consumed by a software system
I = Location-based marginal carbon emissions
M = Embodied emissions of a software system
R = Functional unit (e.g. carbon per additional user, API-call, ML job, etc)

This summarizes to:

```txt
SCI = C per R (Carbon per R)
```

R is the core characteristic of the SCI and turns it into an intensity rather than a total. This is what we call a functional unit.

## Course completion

Upon finishing the final exam after completing the theory chapters, you will receive a course completion certificate and badge from credly.
